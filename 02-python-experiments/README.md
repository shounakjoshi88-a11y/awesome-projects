# 🐍 Python Experiments

> Where I learned that Python is actually way more fun than I thought!

## What's Here

This is my Python journey - from basic scripts that barely worked to automation tools I actually use daily. Honestly, half of these scripts exist because I got tired of doing repetitive stuff manually.

## Folders

- **automation-scripts/** - "Why do this manually when Python can?" energy
- **data-processing/** - Playing with CSV, JSON, and making sense of messy data
- **game-dev-attempts/** - Pygame experiments that spiraled into chaos (fun chaos tho!)

## Key Learnings

💡 List comprehensions are actually beautiful
💡 f-strings changed my life
💡 Exception handling matters (learned this the hard way)
💡 Virtual environments are your friend

Feel free to steal ideas but actually learn them! 😊
