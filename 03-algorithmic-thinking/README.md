# ⚙️ Algorithmic Thinking

> Where I learned that problem-solving is actually beautiful when done right!

## The Vibe

This folder is all about getting comfortable with algorithms and data structures. From basic sorting to competitive programming vibes - it's the foundation that makes everything else possible.

## What's Inside

- **dsa-fundamentals/** - Classic data structure implementations in C (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.)
- **competitive-solutions/** - LeetCode/HackerRank style problems
- **sorting-visualizations/** - Making algorithms pretty (because beauty + code is peak)

## Big Learnings

💡 Time complexity matters WAY more than you think
💡 Space-time tradeoffs are real and important
💡 Clean code + good algorithms = magic
💡 Debugging is 80% of the work

Feel free to use these implementations but understand WHY they work! 🚀
