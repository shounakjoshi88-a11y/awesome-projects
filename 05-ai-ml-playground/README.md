> Where I test 20+ LLM models on my HP Victus (and it gets HOT! 🔥)

## This is the Cutting Edge Section!

Local LLM deployment, model testing, fine-tuning attempts, and understanding how these beasts actually work. This is where the future happens on my laptop.

## What's Here

- **llm-experiments/** - Testing 20+ different models (Hermes, Dolphin, Wizard, Gemma, Qwen, DeepSeek R1, Claude, Llama, Mistral, etc.)
- **fine-tuning-attempts/** - Custom model training and prompt engineering
- **deployment-guides/** - How to actually run LLMs locally without destroying your GPU

## The Real Talk

💡 Ollama is a lifesaver for local testing
💡 Not all models are created equal for coding tasks
💡 Context matters HUGELY
💡 6GB VRAM is the limit - optimization is key
💡 Prompt engineering >>> brute force

Feel free to use my findings but test for yourself! Every setup is different! 🚀
